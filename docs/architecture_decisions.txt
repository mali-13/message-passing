The frontend will emit location events to Kafka. This is done because there will be a large number of such events emitted
in a short period of time. Kafka will be responsible for saving these events, and the Location Service will handle them
at a frequency it can manage (without being overwhelmed). This will be real-time or near real-time when the flux is great.

The frontend will request the list of connections from the Connection Service. The response from the Connection Service
will also include person data, which the Connection Service does not have. To get this data, the Connection Service makes
a gRPC request to the Person Service. gRPC is fast because it uses HTTP/2 (keeps the connection alive longer) and uses
binary size-optimized requests and responses.

To get all persons, the frontend will make a direct REST request to the Person Service. REST is the most popular
message-passing technique, so the frontend team will already have the knowledge to use it. Moreover, the OpenAPI
documentation will help the team discover, explore, and learn the available endpoints quickly and intuitively.
