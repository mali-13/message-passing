Monolithic app is refactored into different modules. The modules interact using different message passing techniques like REST API, Kafka and gRPC as shown in architecture diagram.

Interaction between PersonService, ConnectionService and front-end is using REST API as the amount of information exchange is not huge and fits well with REST techniques.

LocationProducer exposes gRPC interface as the amount of location data that comes in real time scenarios is huge and efficiency is required, which is provided by gRPC. 
Also, the location data received is sent to LocationConsumer using Kafka, as streaming and asynchronous way of processing huge amount of information is efficient.
